Project2:  Fast estimation of non-Gaussian fields

Data derived from remote sensing or from the output of numerical simulations typically has some regular gridded
structure but is large in volume. The challenge is to find accurate spatial models to fill in missing grid cells
or emulate the process in the presence of heterogeneity of the spatial fields and heavy-tailed marginal distributions.
